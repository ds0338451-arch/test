## **Flowchart — Full Detailed Explanation**

### **1\. What is a Flowchart?**

A **flowchart** is a visual diagram that shows the steps of a process in the form of symbols connected by arrows.  
It explains **how something works, step by step**, in an easy-to-understand graphical way.

Flowcharts are used in:

* Programming and algorithms  
* Business processes  
* Decision making  
* Manufacturing and operations  
* Education and training

---

### **2\. Why Flowcharts Are Used**

Flowcharts help to:

* Understand complex processes easily  
* Find mistakes or inefficiencies  
* Plan systems before building them  
* Explain ideas clearly to others  
* Improve communication in teams

### **3\. Main Parts of a Flowchart (Symbols)**

Each symbol has a special meaning:

#### **a) Oval — Start/End**

Shows where the process begins and ends.  
Example:

* Start  
* End

#### **b) Rectangle — Process**

Represents an action or step.  
Example:

* Enter number  
* Calculate total  
* Print result

#### **c) Parallelogram — Input/Output**

Used for taking input or showing output.  
Example:

* Enter your age  
* Display result

#### **d) Diamond — Decision**

Used for yes/no or true/false questions.  
Example:

* Is number \> 10?  
* Is password correct?

#### **e) Arrow — Flow Line**

Shows the direction of steps.  
It connects symbols and shows the order.

#### **f) Circle — Connector**

Used to connect parts of a large flowchart across pages or sections.

### **4\. How a Flowchart Works**

A flowchart always flows from:  
**Top to bottom** or **Left to right**

Steps:

1. Start from the **Start** symbol  
2. Follow arrows through each step  
3. Make decisions at diamonds  
4. End at the **End** symbol

---

### **5\. Example in Words (Simple Flowchart)**

Task: Check if a number is even or odd

Flow:

* Start  
* Input number  
* Is number divisible by 2?  
  * Yes → Print "Even"  
  * No → Print "Odd"  
* End

This shows how decisions change the path.

### **6\. Types of Flowcharts**

#### **a) Process Flowchart**

Shows general steps of a process  
Example: Making tea, order processing

#### **b) Program Flowchart**

Used in programming logic  
Example: Login system, calculator

#### **c) Workflow Flowchart**

Shows work movement between people/departments

#### **d) System Flowchart**

Shows how data moves in a whole system

---

### **7\. Rules for Making a Good Flowchart**

* Use standard symbols  
* Keep it simple and clear  
* One start and one end  
* Avoid crossing lines  
* Write short and clear text  
* Flow should be easy to follow

---

### **8\. Advantages of Flowcharts**

* Easy to understand  
* Visual and clear  
* Helps in planning  
* Finds errors early  
* Saves time in development

---

### **9\. Disadvantages of Flowcharts**

* Large processes become complex  
* Takes time to draw  
* Hard to update if process changes often

---

### **10\. Summary**

A flowchart is a:

* Visual representation of steps  
* Uses symbols like oval, rectangle, diamond  
* Shows sequence and decisions  
* Helps in understanding, planning, and improving processes

In simple words:  
**Flowchart \= Picture of how a process works step by step.**
